Welcome on football team API that indeed interfaces between your data and your client to let you manage your football team

### Tech

The project uses some known golang packages (you easily find more here https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go):

* [Viper] - Manages configuration for your project
* [pflag] - Manages for you the command tools argument parsing
* [gin] - The API framework used to power the project
* [gorm] - The ORM to efficiently query Databases
* [testify] - To efficiently write tests & mocks


### How to use
Since go 1.11 we have a pretty management system integrated to go commands tool: go modules.
The go.mod / go.sum files handles already all the dependencies used in the project so everything should be imported for you at build (except if those library needs you to install system packages)

### Architecture

#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
